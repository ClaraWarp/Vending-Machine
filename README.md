# Vending-Machine

This was one of my big capstones for java coding bootcamp.  It's a vending machine that uses a text file to stock itself and the user interacts with it through the CLI.
And the logs of all the transactions are written to a text file output.  The CLI is pretty easy to use, once you run the app, it'll prompt you with all the options the user
can choose from.
